# Dot Product and Polynomial Mapping in ASM x86

This Assembly x86 project implements a dot product and polynomial mapping function for C float arrays. There is a 32-bit and 64-bit implementation of both functions, accommodating both single and double precision float arrays. The dot product functions return the dot product of two equal-sized arrays, while the polynomial mapping function is used to pass all indices of an array through a polynomial. There is an equivalent implementation in C for each Assembly function for comparison of performance.
